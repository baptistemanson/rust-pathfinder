# Rust Pathfinder

Rust pathfinder is a toy implementation of the basic rules of Pathfinder Second Edition.
My goal is to learn Rust.

MIT and everything. Author Baptiste Manson

Most interesting to code: benchmark, improve roll, 3 actions, position, visual

key takeaways on performances:

- references help
- clone on character is nothing, at least I dont see it
- println! is more costly on windows
- the performance I can reach with Rust I cannot with JS, by a factor x10-100.

## General

- [x] add unit tests
- [x] learn benchmarking
- [x] learn profiling
- [x] setup webgpu
- [x] optimize (went from 80ms to 0.064ms)
- [ ] test the weapon traits

### Rules engine

- [x] add a rule engine
- [x] add multiple actions per turn

### Conditions

- [x] develop condition engine
  - [x] add concept of timers in timeline
  - [x] add condition in character
  - [x] implement dying, bless as PoC

### Equipment

- [x] add equipment to characters
- [x] provide an ergonomic API to add characters and loadouts.

### Runes

- [x] Weapon Potency
- [x] Striking
- [ ] Armor Potency
- [ ] Resilient

### Performance

- [ ] avoid clone on active_character

### Completed âœ“

- [x] action selector / AI
- [x] base project

Weapons that can be modelled with simple callback based hashmap of timings (I scanned 50% of those)

- bloodletting kukri (after attack, src, target, with critical info)
- caterwaul sling (freq)
- dagger of Venom (freq. after attack, activate w/ trigger on damage enemy)
- dwarven thrower
- fighter's fork (activate, position)
- flame tongue (activate)
- frost brand (activate, notion of fire)
- gloomblade (need notion of light, detection, special upgrade)
- holy avenger (at start of round, activate, freq, after attack, on action after successful attack)

- start of action - offer new actions / apply temp reaction status. Need to have previous action.
- end of attack roll - allow to modify results.
- end of damage - modify results.
